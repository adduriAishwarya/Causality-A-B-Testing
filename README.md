# Causality-A-B-Testing
In this notebook, i covered the basics of causality, explored a marketing A/B testing dataset, conducted feature engineering, and understood dataset correlations. I delved into A/B testing fundamentals, formulated hypotheses, and examined randomization's importance. Further, I explored experimental design, analyzed group assignments, and performed tests, revealing dataset skewness towards the "ad" group. Stratified sampling confirmed "ad" group superiority even in balanced datasets. Evaluating A/B test results, I identified non-normality and variance heterogeneity, prompting bootstrapping. Confidence intervals indicated the 'Ad' group's potential effectiveness, despite some overlap with the 'PSA' group. I acknowledged challenges and considerations in A/B testing for causality.
